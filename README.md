Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program. Model developed to predict readmission rates for diabetic patients 


Context: The hospital in which you work has a goal to reduce hospital readmission rates for diabetic patients. Both the hospital finance and clinical care teams are interested in how the data science team may help these departments reach this goal.

Objective: 
- Create a model which predicts whether a patient will be readmitted in <30 days
- Model evaluated on AUC (Area Under Curve), False positive rates, and true positive rates
- Display how rates will be affected, payment, and the bottom line
